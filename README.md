### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is for Simulation and Classification of Wireless Sensor Nodes using Matlab

## About

• In this project we provide the overview of Sensor Nodes and its functionality in a real world monitoring. 

• We are classifying and deploying the nodes randomly over a set of area and assuming that the nodes have capabilities of remote data access and management which can monitor real world habitat. 

• From the data collected over the designated area, we can classify it in terms of Random, Rectangular and Triangular schemes. Within these schemes, we can restrict the data points and obtain the node values of the desired region like North, South, East, West, North-east, North- west, South-east, South-west. 

• We have also added the functionality of Hard and Soft threshold, i.e. whenever the sensors have values greater than the hard threshold, it will transmit the values. After reaching the hard threshold, the sensor will keep transmitting the values till the result varies within the range set by soft threshold.
